## Network

<details>
<summary>In general, what do you need in order to communicate?</summary><br><b>

  - A common language (for the two ends to understand)
  - A way to address who do you want to communicate with
  - A Connection (so the content of the communication can reach the recipients)

</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What is TCP/IP?</summary><br><b>

A set of protocols that define how two or more devices can communicate with each other.

To learn more about TCP/IP, read [here](http://www.penguintutor.com/linux/basic-network-reference)

</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What is Ethernet?</summary><br><b>

Ethernet simply refers to the most common type of Local Area Network (LAN) used today. A LAN—in contrast to a WAN (Wide Area Network), which spans a larger geographical area—is a connected network of computers in a small area, like your office, college campus, or even home.

</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What is a MAC address? What is it used for?</summary><br><b>

A MAC address is a unique identification number or code used to identify individual devices on the network.

Packets that are sent on the ethernet are always coming from a MAC address and sent to a MAC address. If a network adapter is receiving a packet, it is comparing the packet’s destination MAC address to the adapter’s own MAC address.

</b></details>

<details>
<summary>When is this MAC address used?: ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff</summary><br><b>

When a device sends a packet to the broadcast MAC address (FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF​), it is delivered to all stations on the local network. Ethernet broadcasts are used to resolve IP addresses to MAC addresses (by ARP) at the datalink layer .
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What is an IP address?</summary><br><b>

An Internet Protocol address (IP address) is a numerical label assigned to each device connected to a computer network that uses the Internet Protocol for communication.An IP address serves two main functions: host or network interface identification and location addressing.
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>Explain subnet mask and given an example</summary><br><b>

A Subnet mask is a 32-bit number that masks an IP address, and divides the IP address into network address and host address. Subnet Mask is made by setting network bits to all "1"s and setting host bits to all "0"s. Within a given network, out of the total usable host addresses, two are always reserved for specific purposes and cannot be allocated to any host. These are the first address, which is reserved as a network address (a.k.a network ID) and the last address used for network broadcast.

[Example](https://github.com/philemonnwanne/o0o0o/tree/main/exes/exe-09)

</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What is a private IP address? In which scenarios/system designs, one should use it?</summary><br><b>
Private IP addresses are assigned to the hosts in the same network to communicate among one another. As the name "private" suggests, the devices having the private IP addresses assigned can't be reached by the devices from any external network. For example, if I am living in a hostel and I want my hostelmates to join the game server I have hosted, I will ask them to join via my server's private IP address, since the network is local to the hostel.
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What is a public IP address? In which scenarios/system designs, one should use it?</summary><br><b>
A public IP address is the public facing IP address. In the event that you was hosting a game server that you want your friends to join, you will give your friends your public IP address to allow their computers to identify and locate your network and server in order for the connection to take place. One time that you would not need to use a public facing IP address is in the event that you was playing with friends who was connected to the same network as you, in that case, you would use a private ip address. In order for someone to be able to connect to your server that is located internally, you will have to setup a port forward to tell your router to allow traffic from the public domain into your network and vice versa.
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>Explain the OSI model. What layers there are? What each layer is responsible for?</summary><br><b>

- Application: user end (HTTP is here)
- Presentation: establishes context between application-layer entities (Encryption is here)
- Session: establishes, manages and terminates the connections
- Transport: transfers variable-length data sequences from a source to a destination host (TCP & UDP are here)
- Network: transfers datagrams from one network to another (IP is here)
- Data link: provides a link between two directly connected nodes (MAC is here)
- Physical: the electrical and physical spec the data connection (Bits are here)

You can read more about the OSI model in [penguintutor.com](http://www.penguintutor.com/linux/basic-network-reference)

  * Error correction - Data link
  * Packets routing - Network
  * Cables and electrical signals - Physical
  * MAC address - Data link
  * IP address - Network
  * Terminate connections - Session
  * 3 way handshake - Transport
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What delivery schemes are you familiar with?</summary><br><b>

Unitcast: One to one communication where there is one sender and one receiver.

Broadcast: Sending a message to everyone in the network. The address ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff is used for broadcasting.
           Two common protocols which use broadcast are ARP and DHCP.

Multicast: Sending a message to a group of subscribers. It can be one-to-many or many-to-many.
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What is CSMA/CD? Is it used in modern ethernet networks?</summary><br><b>

CSMA/CD stands for Carrier Sense Multiple Access / Collision Detection.
Its primarily focus it to manage access to shared medium/bus where only one host can transmit at a given point of time.

CSMA/CD algorithm:

1. Before sending a frame, it checks whether another host already transmitting a frame.
2. If no one transmitting, it starts transmitting the frame.
3. If two hosts transmitted at the same time, we have a collision.
4. Both hosts stop sending the frame and they send to everyone a 'jam signal' notifying everyone that a collision occurred
5. They are waiting for a random time before sending again
6. Once each host waited for a random time, they try to send the frame again and so the

<summary>Describe the following network devices and the difference between them:

  * router
  * switch
  * hub</summary><br><b>

<summary>What is a "Broadcast Domain"?</summary><br><b>
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>three computers connected to a switch. How many collision domains are there? How many broadcast domains?</summary><br><b>

Three collision domains and one broadcast domain
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>How does a router works?</summary><br><b>

A router is a physical or virtual appliance that passes information between two or more packet-switched computer networks. A router inspects a given data packet's destination Internet Protocol address (IP address), calculates the best way for it to reach its destination and then forwards it accordingly.

</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What is NAT?</summary><br><b>

 Network Address Translation (NAT) is a process in which one or more local IP address is translated into one or more Global IP address and vice versa in order to provide Internet access to the local hosts.

</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What is a proxy? How does it works? What do we need it for?</summary><br><b>

A proxy server acts as a gateway between you and the internet. It’s an intermediary server separating end users from the websites they browse.

If you’re using a proxy server, internet traffic flows through the proxy server on its way to the address you requested. The request then comes back through that same proxy server (there are exceptions to this rule), and then the proxy server forwards the data received from the website to you.

Proxy servers provide varying levels of functionality, security, and privacy depending on your use case, needs, or company policy.
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What is TCP? How does it works? What is the 3 way handshake?</summary><br><b>

TCP 3-way handshake or three-way handshake is a process which is used in a TCP/IP network to make a connection between server and client.

A three-way handshake is primarily used to create a TCP socket connection. It works when:

- A client node sends a SYN data packet over an IP network to a server on the same or an external network. The objective of this packet is to ask/infer if the server is open for new connections.
- The target server must have open ports that can accept and initiate new connections. When the server receives the SYN packet from the client node, it responds and returns a confirmation receipt – the ACK packet or SYN/ACK packet.
- The client node receives the SYN/ACK from the server and responds with an ACK packet.
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What is round-trip delay or round-trip time?</summary><br><b>

From [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Round-trip_delay): "the length of time it takes for a signal to be sent plus the length of time it takes for an acknowledgement of that signal to be received"

Bonus question: what is the RTT of LAN?
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>How does SSL handshake work?</summary><br><b>
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What is the difference between TCP and UDP?</summary><br><b>

TCP establishes a connection between the client and the server to guarantee the order of the packages, on the other hand, UDP does not establish a connection between client and server and doesn't handle package order. This makes UDP more lightweight than TCP and a perfect candidate for services like streaming.

[Penguintutor.com](http://www.penguintutor.com/linux/basic-network-reference) provides a good explanation.
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What TCP/IP protocols are you familiar with?</summary><br><b>
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>Explain "default gateway"</summary><br><b>

A default gateway serves as an access point or IP router that a networked computer uses to send information to a computer in another network or the internet.
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What is ARP? How does it works?</summary><br><b>

ARP stands for Address Resolution Protocol. When you try to ping an IP address on your local network, say 192.168.1.1, your system has to turn the IP address 192.168.1.1 into a MAC address. This involves using ARP to resolve the address, hence its name.

Systems keep an ARP look-up table where they store information about what IP addresses are associated with what MAC addresses. When trying to send a packet to an IP address, the system will first consult this table to see if it already knows the MAC address. If there is a value cached, ARP is not used.
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What is TTL? What does it helps to prevent?</summary><br><b>
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What is DHCP? How does it works?</summary><br><b>

It stands for Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol, and allocates IP addresses, subnet masks and gateways to hosts. This is how it works:

* A host upon entering a network, broadcasts a message in search of a DHCP server (DHCP DISCOVER)
* An offer message is sent back by the DHCP server as a packet containing lease time, subnet mask, IP addresses, etc (DHCP OFFER)
* Depending on which offer accepted, the client sends back a reply broadcast letting all DHCP servers know (DHCP REQUEST)
* Server sends an acknowledgment (DHCP ACK)

</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What is VLAN?</summary><br><b>
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What is MTU?</summary><br><b>
	
MTU stands for Maximum Transmission Unit. It's the size of the largest PDU (protocol Data Unit) that can be sent in a single transaction.
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What happens if you send a packet that is bigger than the MTU?</summary><br><b>
	
With IPv4 protocol, router can fragment the PDU then sending all the fragmented PDU through the transaction.
	
With IPv6 protocol, it issues a error to the user's computer.

</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What is ICMP? What is it used for?</summary><br><b>
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What is NAT? How does it work?</summary><br><b>

NAT stands for network address translation. It’s a way to map multiple local private addresses to a public one before transferring the information. Organizations that want multiple devices to employ a single IP address use NAT, as do most home routers.
For example, your computer's private IP could be 192.168.1.100, but your router maps the traffic to it's public IP (e.g. 1.1.1.1). Any device on the internet would see the traffic coming from your public IP (1.1.1.1) instead of your private IP (192.168.1.100).

<summary>What is HSTS?</summary><br><b>
HTTP Strict Transport Security is a web server directive that informs user agents and web browsers how to handle its connection through a response header sent at the very beginning and back to the browser. This forces connections over HTTPS encryption, disregarding any script's call to load any resource in that domain over HTTP.

### Operating System - Self Assessment

<details>
<summary>What is an operating system?</summary><br><b>

From the book "Operating Systems: Three Easy Pieces":

"responsible for making it easy to run programs (even allowing you to seemingly run many at the same time), allowing programs to share memory, enabling programs to interact with devices, and other fun stuff like that".
</b></details>

#### Operating System - Process

<details>
<summary>Can you explain what is a process?</summary><br><b>

A process is a running program. A program is one or more instructions and the program (or process) is executed by the operating system.
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>If you had to design an API for processes in an operating system, what would this API look like?</summary><br><b>

It would support the following:

* Create - allow to create new processes
* Delete - allow to remove/destroy processes
* State - allow to check the state of the process, whether it's running, stopped, waiting, etc.
* Stop - allow to stop a running process
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>How a process is created?</summary><br><b>

* The OS is reading program's code and any additional relevant data
* Program's code is loaded into the memory or more specifically, into the address space of the process.
* Memory is allocated for program's stack (aka run-time stack). The stack also initialized by the OS with data like argv, argc and parameters to main()
* Memory is allocated for program's heap which is required for dynamically allocated data like the data structures linked lists and hash tables
* I/O initialization tasks are performed, like in Unix/Linux based systems where each process has 3 file descriptors (input, output and error)
* OS is running the program, starting from main()
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>True or False? The loading of the program into the memory is done eagerly (all at once)</summary><br><b>

False. It was true in the past but today's operating systems perform lazy loading which means only the relevant pieces required for the process to run are loaded first.
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What are different states of a process?</summary><br><b>

* Running - it's executing instructions
* Ready - it's ready to run but for different reasons it's on hold
* Blocked - it's waiting for some operation to complete. For example I/O disk request
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What are some reasons for a process to become blocked?</summary><br><b>

  - I/O operations (e.g. Reading from a disk)
  - Waiting for a packet from a network
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What is Inter Process Communication (IPC)?</summary><br><b>
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What is "time sharing"?</summary><br><b>

Even when using a system with one physical CPU, it's possible to allow multiple users to work on it and run programs. This is possible with time sharing where computing resources are shared in a way it seems to the user the system has multiple CPUs but in fact it's simply one CPU shared by applying multiprogramming and multi-tasking.
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What is "space sharing"?</summary><br><b>

Somewhat the opposite of time sharing. While in time sharing a resource is used for a while by one entity and then the same resource can be used by another resource, in space sharing the space is shared by multiple entities but in a way where it's not being transferred between them.<br>
It's used by one entity until this entity decides to get rid of it. Take for example storage. In storage, a file is yours until you decide to delete it.
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What component determines which process runs at a given moment in time?</summary><br><b>

CPU scheduler
</b></details>

#### Operating System - Memory

<details>
<summary>What is "virtual memory" and what purpose it serves?</summary><br><b>

Virtual memory combines your computer's RAM with temporary space on your hard disk. When RAM runs low, virtual memory helps to move data from RAM to a space called a paging file. Moving data to paging file can free up the RAM so your computer can complete its work. In general, the more RAM your computer has, the faster the programs run.
https://www.minitool.com/lib/virtual-memory.html
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What is demand paging?</summary><br><b>
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What is copy-on-write or shadowing?</summary><br><b>
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What is a kernel, and what does it do?</summary><br><b>

The kernel is part of the operating system and is responsible for tasks like:

  * Allocating memory
  * Schedule processes
  * Control CPU
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>True or False? Some pieces of the code in the kernel are loaded into protected areas of the memory so applications can't overwritten them</summary><br><b>

True
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What is POSIX?</summary><br><b>
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>Explain what is Semaphore and what its role in operating systems</summary><br><b>
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What is cache? What is buffer?</summary><br><b>

Buffer: Reserved place in RAM which is used to hold data for temporary purposes
Cache: Cache is usually used when processes reading and writing to the disk to make the process faster by making similar data used by different programs easily accessible.
</b></details>

## Virtualization

<details>
<summary>What is Virtualization?</summary><br><b>

Virtualization uses software to create an abstraction layer over computer hardware that allows the hardware elements of a single computer—processors, memory, storage and more - to be divided into multiple virtual computers, commonly called virtual machines (VMs).
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What is a hypervisor?</summary><br><b>

Red Hat: "A hypervisor is software that creates and runs virtual machines (VMs). A hypervisor, sometimes called a virtual machine monitor (VMM), isolates the hypervisor operating system and resources from the virtual machines and enables the creation and management of those VMs."

Read more [here](https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/virtualization/what-is-a-hypervisor)
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What types of hypervisors are there?</summary><br><b>

Hosted hypervisors and bare-metal hypervisors.
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What are the advantages and disadvantges of bare-metal hypervisor over a hosted hypervisor?</summary><br><b>

Due to having its own drivers and a direct access to hardware components, a baremetal hypervisor will often have better performances along with stability and scalability.

On the other hand, there will probably be some limitation regarding loading (any) drivers so a hosted hypervisor will usually benefit from having a better hardware compatibility.
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What types of virtualization are there?</summary><br><b>

Operating system virtualization
Network functions virtualization
Desktop virtualization
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>Is containerization is a type of Virtualization?</summary><br><b>

Yes, it's a operating-system-level virtualization, where the kernel is shared and allows to use multiple isolated user-spaces instances.
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>How the introduction of virtual machines changed the industry and the way applications were deployed?</summary><br><b>

The introduction of virtual machines allowed companies to deploy multiple business applications on the same hardware while each application is separated from each other in secured way, where each is running on its own separate operating system.
</b></details>

#### Virtual Machines

<details>
<summary>Do we need virtual machines in the age of containers? Are they still relevant?</summary><br><b>
</b></details>

## Monitoring

<details>
<summary>Explain monitoring. What is it? What its goal?</summary><br><b>

Google: "Monitoring is one of the primary means by which service owners keep track of a system’s health and availability".
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What is wrong with the old approach of watching for a specific value and trigger an email/phone alert while value is exceeded?</summary><br><b>

This approach require from a human to always check why the value exceeded and how to handle it while today, it is more effective to notify people only when they need to take an actual action.
If the issue doesn't require any human intervention, then the problem can be fixed by some processes running in the relevant environment.
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What types of monitoring outputs are you familiar with and/or used in the past?</summary><br><b>

Alerts<br>
Tickets<br>
Logging<br>

## Go

<details>
<summary>What are some characteristics of the Go programming language?</summary><br><b>

  * Strong and static typing - the type of the variables can't be changed over time and they have to be defined at compile time
  * Simplicity
  * Fast compile times
  * Built-in concurrency
  * Garbage collected
  * Platform independent
  * Compile to standalone binary - anything you need to run your app will be compiled into one binary. Very useful for version management in run-time.

Go also has good community.
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What is the difference between <code>var x int = 2</code> and <code>x := 2</code>?</summary><br><b>

The result is the same, a variable with the value 2.

With <code>var x int = 2</code> we are setting the variable type to integer while with <code>x := 2</code> we are letting Go figure out by itself the type.
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>True or False? In Go we can redeclare variables and once declared we must use it.</summary>

False. We can't redeclare variables but yes, we must used declared variables.
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What libraries of Go have you used?</summary><br><b>

This should be answered based on your usage but some examples are:

  * fmt - formatted I/O
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What is the problem with the following block of code? How to fix it?

```
func main() {
    var x float32 = 13.5
    var y int
    y = x
}
```
</summary><br><b>
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>The following block of code tries to convert the integer 101 to a string but instead we get "e". Why is that? How to fix it?

```
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    var x int = 101
    var y string
    y = string(x)
    fmt.Println(y)
}
```
</summary><br><b>

It looks what unicode value is set at 101 and uses it for converting the integer to a string.
If you want to get "101" you should use the package "strconv" and replace <code>y = string(x)</code> with <code>y = strconv.Itoa(x)</code>
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What is wrong with the following code?:

```
package main

func main() {
    var x = 2
    var y = 3
    const someConst = x + y
}
```
</summary><br><b>

Constants in Go can only be declared using constant expressions.
But `x`, `y` and their sum is variable.
<br>
<code>const initializer x + y is not a constant</code>
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What will be the output of the following block of code?:

```
package main

import "fmt"

const (
	x = iota
	y = iota
)
const z = iota

func main() {
	fmt.Printf("%v\n", x)
	fmt.Printf("%v\n", y)
	fmt.Printf("%v\n", z)
}
```
</summary><br><b>

Go's iota identifier is used in const declarations to simplify definitions of incrementing numbers. Because it can be used in expressions, it provides a generality beyond that of simple enumerations.
<br>
`x` and `y` in the first iota group, `z` in the second.

In `mod1` a is link, and when we're using `a[i]`, we're changing `s1` value to.
But in `mod2`, `append` creats new slice, and we're changing only `a` value, not `s2`.

- No complex joins
- Structure of a single object is clear

</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What is the difference between SQL and NoSQL?</summary><br><b>

The main difference is that SQL databases are structured (data is stored in the form of
tables with rows and columns - like an excel spreadsheet table) while NoSQL is
unstructured, and the data storage can vary depending on how the NoSQL DB is set up, such
as key-value pair, document-oriented, etc.
</b></details>

### SQL Self Assessment

<details>
<summary>What is SQL?</summary><br><b>

SQL (Structured Query Language) is a standard language for relational databases (like MySQL, MariaDB, ...).<br>
It's used for reading, updating, removing and creating data in a relational database.
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>How is SQL Different from NoSQL</summary><br><b>

The main difference is that SQL databases are structured (data is stored in the form of
tables with rows and columns - like an excel spreadsheet table) while NoSQL is
unstructured, and the data storage can vary depending on how the NoSQL DB is set up, such
as key-value pair, document-oriented, etc.
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>When is it best to use SQL? NoSQL?</summary><br><b>

SQL - Best used when data integrity is crucial. SQL is typically implemented with many
businesses and areas within the finance field due to it's ACID compliance.

NoSQL - Great if you need to scale things quickly. NoSQL was designed with web applications
in mind, so it works great if you need to quickly spread the same information around to
multiple servers

Additionally, since NoSQL does not adhere to the strict table with columns and rows structure
that Relational Databases require, you can store different data types together.
</b></details>

##### Practical SQL - Basics

For these questions, we will be using the Customers and Orders tables shown below:

**Customers**

Customer_ID | Customer_Name | Items_in_cart | Cash_spent_to_Date
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
100204 | John Smith | 0 | 20.00
100205 | Jane Smith | 3 | 40.00
100206 | Bobby Frank | 1 | 100.20

**ORDERS**

Customer_ID | Order_ID | Item | Price | Date_sold
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
100206 | A123 | Rubber Ducky | 2.20 | 2019-09-18
100206 | A123 | Bubble Bath | 8.00 | 2019-09-18

100204 | X202 | Coffee | 20.00 | 2019-04-29

<details>
<summary>How would I select all fields from this table?</summary><br><b>

Select * <br>
From Customers;
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>How many items are in John's cart?</summary><br><b>

Select Items_in_cart <br>
From Customers <br>
Where Customer_Name = "John Smith";
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What is the sum of all the cash spent across all customers?</summary><br><b>

Select SUM(Cash_spent_to_Date) as SUM_CASH <br>
From Customers;
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>How many people have items in their cart?</summary><br><b>

Select count(1) as Number_of_People_w_items <br>
From Customers <br>
where Items_in_cart > 0;
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>How would you join the customer table to the order table?</summary><br><b>

You would join them on the unique key. In this case, the unique key is Customer_ID in
both the Customers table and Orders table
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>How would you show which customer ordered which items?</summary><br><b>

Select c.Customer_Name, o.Item <br>
From Customers c <br>
Left Join Orders o <br>
  On c.Customer_ID = o.Customer_ID;

</b></details>

<details>
<summary>Using a with statement, how would you show who ordered cat food, and the total amount of money spent?</summary><br><b>

with cat_food as ( <br>
Select Customer_ID, SUM(Price) as TOTAL_PRICE <br>
From Orders <br>
Where Item like "%Cat Food%" <br>
Group by Customer_ID <br>
) <br>
Select Customer_name, TOTAL_PRICE <br>
From Customers c <br>
Inner JOIN cat_food f <br>
  ON c.Customer_ID = f.Customer_ID <br>
where c.Customer_ID in (Select Customer_ID from cat_food);

Although this was a simple statement, the "with" clause really shines when
a complex query needs to be run on a table before joining to another. With statements are nice,
because you create a pseudo temp when running your query, instead of creating a whole new table.

The Sum of all the purchases of cat food weren't readily available, so we used a with statement to create
the pseudo table to retrieve the sum of the prices spent by each customer, then join the table normally.

</b></details>
<details>
<summary>Explain Puppet architecture</summary><br><b>

  * Puppet has a primary-secondary node architecture. The clients are distributed across the network and communicate with the primary-secondary environment where Puppet modules are present. The client agent sends a certificate with its ID to the server; the server then signs that certificate and sends it back to the client. This authentication allows for secure and verifiable communication between the client and the master.

## Elastic

<details>
<summary>What is the Elastic Stack?</summary><br><b>

The Elastic Stack consists of:

  * Elasticsearch
  * Kibana
  * Logstash
  * Beats
  * Elastic Hadoop
  * APM Server

Elasticserach, Logstash and Kibana are also known as the ELK stack.
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>Explain what is Elasticsearch</summary><br><b>

From the official [docs](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/documents-indices.html):

"Elasticsearch is a distributed document store. Instead of storing information as rows of columnar data, Elasticsearch stores complex data structures that have been serialized as JSON documents"
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What is Logstash?</summary><br><b>
	
From the [blog](https://logit.io/blog/post/the-top-50-elk-stack-and-elasticsearch-interview-questions):

"Logstash is a powerful, flexible pipeline that collects, enriches and transports data. It works as an extract, transform & load (ETL) tool for collecting log messages."
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>Explain what beats are</summary><br><b>

Beats are lightweight data shippers. These data shippers installed on the client where the data resides.
Examples of beats: Filebeat, Metricbeat, Auditbeat. There are much more.<br>
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What is Kibana?</summary><br><b>

From the official docs:

"Kibana is an open source analytics and visualization platform designed to work with Elasticsearch. You use Kibana to search, view, and interact with data stored in Elasticsearch indices. You can easily perform advanced data analysis and visualize your data in a variety of charts, tables, and maps."
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>Describe what happens from the moment an app logged some information until it's displayed to the user in a dashboard when the Elastic stack is used</summary><br><b>

The process may vary based on the chosen architecture and the processing you may want to apply to the logs. One possible workflow is:

1. The data logged by the application is picked by filebeat and sent to logstash
2. Logstash process the log based on the defined filters. Once done, the output is sent to Elasticsearch
2. Elasticsearch stores the document it got and the document is indexed for quick future access
4. The user creates visualizations in Kibana which based on the indexed data
5. The user creates a dashboard which composed out of the visualization created in the previous step
</b></details>

##### Elasticsearch

<details>
<summary>What is a data node?</summary><br><b>

This is where data is stored and also where different processing takes place (e.g. when you search for a data).
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What is a master node?</summary><br><b>

Par of a master node responsibilites:
  * Track the status of all the nodes in the cluster
  * Verify replicas are working and the data is available from every data node.
  * No hot nodes (no data node that works much harder than other nodes)

While there can be multiple master nodes in reality only of them is the elected master node.
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What is an ingest node?</summary><br><b>

A node which responsible for parsing the data. In case you don't use logstash then this node can recieve data from beats and parse it, similarly to how it can be parsed in Logstash.
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What is Coordinating node?</summary><br><b>

A Coordinating node responsible for routing requests out and in to the cluser (data nodes).
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>How data is stored in elasticsearch?</summary><br><b>

* Data is stored in an index
* The index is spread across the cluster using shards
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What is an Index?</summary><br><b>

Index in Elastic is in most cases compared to a whole database from the SQL/NoSQL world.<br>
You can choose to have one index to hold all the data of your app or have multiple indices where each index holds different type of your app (e.g. index for each service your app is running).

The official docs also offer a great explanation (in general, it's really good documentation, as every project should have):

"An index can be thought of as an optimized collection of documents and each document is a collection of fields, which are the key-value pairs that contain your data"
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>Explain Shards</summary><br><b>

An index is split into shards and documents are hashed to a particular shard. Each shard may be on a different node in a cluster and each one of the shards is a self contained index.<br>
This allows Elasticsearch to scale to an entire cluster of servers.
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What is an Inverted Index?</summary><br><b>

From the official docs:

"An inverted index lists every unique word that appears in any document and identifies all of the documents each word occurs in."
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What is a Document?</summary><br><b>

Continuing with the comparison to SQL/NoSQL a Document in Elastic is a row in table in the case of SQL or a document in a collection in the case of NoSQL.
As in NoSQL a Document is a JSON object which holds data on a unit in your app. What is this unit depends on the your app. If your app related to book then each document describes a book. If you are app is about shirts then each document is a shirt.
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>You check the health of your elasticsearch cluster and it's red. What does it mean? What can cause the status to be yellow instead of green?</summary><br><b>

Red means some data is unavailable.
Yellow can be caused by running single node cluster instead of multi-node.
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>True or False? Elasticsearch indexes all data in every field and each indexed field has the same data structure for unified and quick query ability</summary><br><b>

False.
From the official docs:

"Each indexed field has a dedicated, optimized data structure. For example, text fields are stored in inverted indices, and numeric and geo fields are stored in BKD trees."
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What reserved fields a document has?</summary><br><b>

  * _index
  * _id
  * _type
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>Explain Mapping</summary><br><b>
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What are the advantages of defining your own mapping? (or: when would you use your own mapping?)</summary><br><b>

* You can optimize fields for partial matching
* You can define custom formats of known fields (e.g. date)
* You can perform language-specific analysis
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>Explain Replicas</summary><br><b>

In a network/cloud environment where failures can be expected any time, it is very useful and highly recommended to have a failover mechanism in case a shard/node somehow goes offline or disappears for whatever reason.
To this end, Elasticsearch allows you to make one or more copies of your index’s shards into what are called replica shards, or replicas for short.
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>Can you explain Term Frequency & Document Frequency?</summary><br><b>

Term Frequency is how often a term appears in a given document and Document Frequency is how often a term appears in all documents. They both are used for determining the relevance of a term by calculating Term Frequency / Document Frequency.
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>You check "Current Phase" under "Index lifecycle management" and you see it's set to "hot". What does it mean?</summary><br><b>

"The index is actively being written to".
More about the phases [here](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.6/ilm-policy-definition.html)
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What this command does? <code>curl -X PUT "localhost:9200/customer/_doc/1?pretty" -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d'{ "name": "John Doe" }'</code></summary><br><b>

It creates customer index if it doesn't exists and adds a new document with the field name which is set to "John Dow". Also, if it's the first document it will get the ID 1.
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What will happen if you run the previous command twice? What about running it 100 times?</code></summary><br><b>

1. If name value was different then it would update "name" to the new value
2. In any case, it bumps version field by one
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What is the Bulk API? What would you use it for?</code></summary><br><b>

Bulk API is used when you need to index multiple documents. For high number of documents it would be significantly faster to use rather than individual requests since there are less network roundtrips.
</b></details>

##### Query DSL

<details>
<summary>Explain Elasticsearch query syntax (Booleans, Fields, Ranges)</summary><br><b>
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>Explain what is Relevance Score</summary><br><b>
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>Explain Query Context and Filter Context</summary><br><b>

From the official docs:

"In the query context, a query clause answers the question “How well does this document match this query clause?” Besides deciding whether or not the document matches, the query clause also calculates a relevance score in the _score meta-field."

"In a filter context, a query clause answers the question “Does this document match this query clause?” The answer is a simple Yes or No — no scores are calculated. Filter context is mostly used for filtering structured data"
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>Describe how would an architecture of production environment with large amounts of data would be different from a small-scale environment</summary><br><b>

There are several possible answers for this question. One of them is as follows:

A small-scale architecture of elastic will consist of the elastic stack as it is. This means we will have beats, logstash, elastcsearch and kibana.<br>
A production environment with large amounts of data can include some kind of buffering component (e.g. Reddis or RabbitMQ) and also security component such as Nginx.
</b></details>

##### Logstash

<details>

## Distributed

<details>
<summary>Explain Distributed Computing (or Distributed System)</summary><br><b>

According to Martin Kleppmann:

"Many processes running on many machines...only message-passing via an unreliable network with variable delays, and the system may suffer from partial failures, unreliable clocks, and process pauses."

Another definition: "Systems that are physically separated, but logically connected"
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What can cause a system to fail?</summary><br><b>

* Availability: Every request receives a response (it doesn't has to be the most recent data)
* Consistency: Every request receives a response with the latest/most recent data
* Partition tolerance: Even if some the data is lost/dropped, the system keeps running

<summary>What happens when you type in a URL in an address bar in a browser?</summary><br><b>

1. The browser searches for the record of the domain name IP address in the DNS in the following order:
  * Browser cache
  * Operating system cache
  * The DNS server configured on the user's system (can be ISP DNS, public DNS, ...)
2. If it couldn't find a DNS record locally, a full DNS resolution is started.
3. It connects to the server using the TCP protocol
4. The browser sends an HTTP request to the server
5. The server sends an HTTP response back to the browser
6. The browser renders the response (e.g. HTML)
7. The browser then sends subsequent requests as needed to the server to get the embedded links, javascript, images in the HTML and then steps 3 to 5 are repeated.

#### Load Balancers

<details>
<summary>What is a load balancer?</summary><br><b>

A load balancer accepts (or denies) incoming network traffic from a client, and based on some criteria (application related, network, etc.) it distributes those communications out to servers (at least one).
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>Why to used a load balancer?</summary><br><b>

* Scalability - using a load balancer, you can possibly add more servers in the backend to handle more requests/traffic from the clients, as opposed to using one server.
* Redundancy - if one server in the backend dies, the load balancer will keep forwarding the traffic/requests to the second server so users won't even notice one of the servers in the backend is down.
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What load balancer techniques/algorithms are you familiar with?</summary><br><b>

  * Round Robin
  * Weighted Round Robin
  * Least Connection
  * Weighted Least Connection
  * Resource Based
  * Fixed Weighting
  * Weighted Response Time
  * Source IP Hash
  * URL Hash
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What are the drawbacks of round robin algorithm in load balancing?</summary><br><b>

  * A simple round robin algorithm knows nothing about the load and the spec of each server it forwards the requests to. It is possible, that multiple heavy workloads requests will get to the same server while other servers will got only lightweight requests which will result in one server doing most of the work, maybe even crashing at some point because it unable to handle all the heavy workloads requests by its own.
  * Each request from the client creates a whole new session. This might be a problem for certain scenarios where you would like to perform multiple operations where the server has to know about the result of operation so basically, being sort of aware of the history it has with the client. In round robin, first request might hit server X, while second request might hit server Y and ask to continue processing the data that was processed on server X already.

#### Load Balancers - Sticky Sessions

<details>
<summary>What are sticky sessions? What are their pros and cons?</summary><br><b>

Recommended read:
  * [Red Hat Article](https://access.redhat.com/solutions/900933)

Cons:
  * Can cause uneven load on instance (since requests routed to the same instances)
Pros:
  * Ensures in-proc sessions are not lost when a new request is created
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>Name one use case for using sticky sessions</summary><br><b>

You would like to make sure the user doesn't lose the current session data.
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What sticky sessions use for enabling the "stickiness"?</summary><br><b>

Cookies. There are application based cookies and duration based cookies.
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>Explain application-based cookies</summary><br><b>

* Generated by the application and/or the load balancer
* Usually allows to include custom data
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>Explain duration-based cookies</summary><br><b>

* Generated by the load balancer
* Session is not sticky anymore once the duration elapsed

  * Weighted Response Time
  * Source IP Hash
  * URL Hash
</summary><br><b>
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>Explain use case for connection draining?</summary><br><b>
To ensure that a Classic Load Balancer stops sending requests to instances that are de-registering or unhealthy, while keeping the existing connections open, use connection draining. This enables the load balancer to complete in-flight requests made to instances that are de-registering or unhealthy.

The maximum timeout value can be set between 1 and 3,600 seconds on both GCP and AWS.

## Questions you CAN ask

A list of questions you as a candidate can ask the interviewer during or after the interview.
These are only a suggestion, use them carefully. Not every interviewer will be able to answer these (or happy to) which should be perhaps a red flag warning for your regarding working in such place but that's really up to you.

<details>
<summary>What do you like about working here?</summary><br><b>
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>How does the company promote personal growth?</summary><br><b>
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What is the current level of technical debt you are dealing with?</summary><br><b>

Be careful when asking this question - all companies, regardless of size, have some level of tech debt.
Phrase the question in the light that all companies have the deal with this, but you want to see the current
pain points they are dealing with <br>

This is a great way to figure how managers deal with unplanned work, and how good they are at
setting expectations with projects.
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>Why I should NOT join you? (or 'what you don't like about working here?')</summary><br><b>
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What was your favorite project you've worked on?</summary><br><b>

This can give you insights in some of the cool projects a company is working on, and if
you would enjoy working on projects like these. This is also a good way to see if
the managers are allowing employees to learn and grow with projects outside of the
normal work you'd do.
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>If you could change one thing about your day to day, what would it be?</summary><br><b>

Similar to the tech debt question, this helps you identify any pain points with the company.
Additionally, it can be a great way to show how you'd be an asset to the team.<br>

For Example, if they mention they have problem X, and you've solved that in the past,
you can show how you'd be able to mitigate that problem.
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>Let's say that we agree and you hire me to this position, after X months, what do you expect that I have achieved?</summary><br><b>

Not only this will tell you what is expected from you, it will also provide big hint on the type of work you are going to do in the first months of your job.

|--------|--------|------|----|----|
| Message Board Tables  | Relational DB Tables | [Exercise](topics/databases/table_for_message_board_system.md) | [Solution](topics/databases/solutions/table_for_message_board_system.md)

<details>
<summary>What is a relational database?</summary><br><b>

  * Data Storage: system to store data in tables
  * SQL: programming language to manage relational databases
  * Data Definition Language: a standard syntax to create, alter and delete tables
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What does it mean when a database is ACID compliant?</summary><br>

ACID stands for Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability. In order to be ACID compliant, the database must meet each of the four criteria

**Atomicity** - When a change occurs to the database, it should either succeed or fail as a whole.

For example, if you were to update a table, the update should completely execute. If it only partially executes, the
update is considered failed as a whole, and will not go through - the DB will revert back to it's original
state before the update occurred. It should also be mentioned that Atomicity ensures that each
transaction is completed as it's own stand alone "unit" - if any part fails, the whole statement fails.

**Consistency** - any change made to the database should bring it from one valid state into the next.

For example, if you make a change to the DB, it shouldn't corrupt it. Consistency is upheld by checks and constraints that
are pre-defined in the DB. For example, if you tried to change a value from a string to an int when the column
should be of datatype string, a consistent DB would not allow this transaction to go through, and the action would
not be executed

**Isolation** - this ensures that a database will never be seen "mid-update" - as multiple transactions are running at
the same time, it should still leave the DB in the same state as if the transactions were being run sequentially.

For example, let's say that 20 other people were making changes to the database at the same time. At the
time you executed your query, 15 of the 20 changes had gone through, but 5 were still in progress. You should
only see the 15 changes that had completed - you wouldn't see the database mid-update as the change goes through.

**Durability** - Once a change is committed, it will remain committed regardless of what happens
(power failure, system crash, etc.). This means that all completed transactions
must be recorded in non-volatile memory.

Note that SQL is by nature ACID compliant. Certain NoSQL DB's can be ACID compliant depending on
how they operate, but as a general rule of thumb, NoSQL DB's are not considered ACID compliant

<summary>What is sharding?</summary><br><b>

Sharding is a horizontal partitioning.

Are you able to explain what is it good for?
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>You find out your database became a bottleneck and users experience issues accessing data. How can you deal with such situation?</summary><br><b>

Not much information provided as to why it became a bottleneck and what is current architecture, so one general approach could be<br>
to reduce the load on your database by moving frequently-accessed data to in-memory structure.
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What is a connection pool?</summary><br><b>

Connection Pool is a cache of database connections and the reason it's used is to avoid an overhead of establishing a connection for every query done to a database.
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What is a connection leak?</summary><br><b>

A connection leak is a situation where database connection isn't closed after being created and is no longer needed.
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What is Table Lock?</summary><br><b>
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>Your database performs slowly than usual. More specifically, your queries are taking a lot of time. What would you do?</summary><br><b>

* Query for running queries and cancel the irrelevant queries
* Check for connection leaks (query for running connections and include their IP)
* Check for table locks and kill irrelevant locking sessions
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What is a Data Warehouse?</summary><br><b>

<summary>What is an index in a database?</summary><br><b>

A database index is a data structure that improves the speed of operations in a table. Indexes can be created using one or more columns, providing the basis for both rapid random lookups and efficient ordering of access to records.
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What data types are there in relational databases?</summary><br><b>
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>Explain Normalization</summary><br><b>

Data that is used multiple times in a database should be stored once and referenced with a foreign key.<br>
This has the clear benefit of ease of maintenance where you need to change a value only in a single place to change it everywhere.
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>Explain Primary Key and Foreign Key</summary><br><b>

Primary Key: each row in every table should a unique identifier that represents the row.<br>
Foreign Key: a reference to another table's primary key. This allows you to join table together to retrieve all the information you need without duplicating data.
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What types of data tables have you used?</summary><br><b>

  * Primary data table: main data you care about
  * Details table: includes a foreign key and has one to many relationship
  * Lookup values table: can be one table per lookup or a table containing all the lookups and has one to many relationship
  * Multi reference table
</b></details>

<summary>What is ORM? What benefits it provides in regards to relational databases usage?</summary><br><b>

[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object%E2%80%93relational_mapping): "is a programming technique for converting data between incompatible type systems using object-oriented programming languages"

In regards to the relational databases:

  * Database as code

<summary>Explain what is a "Single point of failure"?</summary><br><b>
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What is CDN?</summary><br><b>

CDN (Content Delivery Network) responsible for distributing content geographically. Part of it, is what is known as edge locations, aka cache proxies, that allows users to get their content quickly due to cache features and geographical distribution.
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>Explain Multi-CDN</summary><br><b>

In single CDN, the whole content is originated from content delivery network.<br>
In multi-CDN, content is distributed across multiple different CDNs, each might be on a completely different provider/cloud.
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What are the benefits of Multi-CDN over a single CDN?</summary><br><b>

* Resiliency: Relying on one CDN means no redundancy. With multiple CDNs you don't need to worry about your CDN being down
* Flexibility in Costs: Using one CDN enforces you to specific rates of that CDN. With multiple CDNs you can take into consideration using less expensive CDNs to deliver the content.
* Performance: With Multi-CDN there is bigger potential in choosing better locations which more close to the client asking the content
* Scale: With multiple CDNs, you can scale services to support more extreme conditions

<details>
<summary>Explain Mono-repo vs. Multi-repo. What are the cons and pros of each approach?</summary><br><b>
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What are the drawbacks of monolithic architecture?</summary><br><b>

* Not suitable for frequent code changes and the ability to deploy new features
* Not designed for today's infrastructure (like public clouds)
* Scaling a team to work monolithic architecture is more challenging
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What are the advantages of microservices architecture over a monolithic architecture?</summary><br><b>

* Each of the services individually fail without escalating into an application-wide outage.
* Each service can be developed and maintained by a separate team and this team can choose its own tools and coding language
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What's a service mesh?</summary><br><b>

[This article](https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/microservices/what-is-a-service-mesh) provides a great explanation.

#### Scalability

<details>
<summary>Explain Scalability</summary><br><b>

The ability easily grow in size and capacity based on demand and usage.
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>Explain Elasticity</summary><br><b>

The ability to grow but also to reduce based on what is required
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>Explain Disaster Recovery</summary><br><b>
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>Explain Fault Tolerance and High Availability</summary><br><b>

Fault Tolerance - The ability to self-heal and return to normal capacity. Also the ability to withstand a failure and remain functional.

High Availability - Being able to access a resource (in some use cases, using different platforms)
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What is the difference between high availability and Disaster Recovery?</summary><br><b>

[wintellect.com](https://www.wintellect.com/high-availability-vs-disaster-recovery): "High availability, simply put, is eliminating single points of failure and disaster recovery is the process of getting a system back to an operational state when a system is rendered inoperative. In essence, disaster recovery picks up when high availability fails, so HA first."
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>Explain Vertical Scaling</summary><br><b>

Vertical Scaling is the process of adding resources to increase power of existing servers. For example, adding more CPUs, adding more RAM, etc.
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What are the disadvantages of Vertical Scaling?</summary><br><b>

With vertical scaling alone, the component still remains a single point of failure.
In addition, it has hardware limit where if you don't have more resources, you might not be able to scale vertically.
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>Which type of cloud services usually support vertical scaling?</summary><br><b>

Databases, cache. It's common mostly for non-distributed systems.
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>Explain Horizontal Scaling</summary><br><b>

Horizontal Scaling is the process of adding more resources that will be able handle requests as one unit
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What is the disadvantage of Horizontal Scaling? What is often required in order to perform Horizontal Scaling?</summary><br><b>

A load balancer. You can add more resources, but if you would like them to be part of the process, you have to serve them the requests/responses.
Also, data inconsistency is a concern with horizontal scaling.
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>Explain in which use cases will you use vertical scaling and in which use cases you will use horizontal scaling</summary><br><b>

<details>
<summary>What is the problem with the following architecture and how would you fix it?<br>
<img src="images/design/producers_consumers_issue.png" width="400x;" height="300px;"/>
</summary><br><b>

The load on the producers or consumers may be high which will then cause them to hang or crash.<br>
Instead of working in "push mode", the consumers can pull tasks only when they are ready to handle them. It can be fixed by using a streaming platform like Kafka, Kinesis, etc. This platform will make sure to handle the high load/traffic and pass tasks/messages to consumers only when the ready to get them.

## Hardware

<details>
<summary>What is a CPU?</summary><br><b>

A central processing unit (CPU) performs basic arithmetic, logic, controlling, and input/output (I/O) operations specified by the instructions in the program. This contrasts with external components such as main memory and I/O circuitry, and specialized processors such as graphics processing units (GPUs).
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What is RAM?</summary><br><b>

RAM (Random Access Memory) is the hardware in a computing device where the operating system (OS), application programs and data in current use are kept so they can be quickly reached by the device's processor. RAM is the main memory in a computer. It is much faster to read from and write to than other kinds of storage, such as a hard disk drive (HDD), solid-state drive (SSD) or optical drive.
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What is an embedded system?</summary><br><b>

An embedded system is a computer system - a combination of a computer processor, computer memory, and input/output peripheral devices—that has a dedicated function within a larger mechanical or electronic system. It is embedded as part of a complete device often including electrical or electronic hardware and mechanical parts.

<summary>What is Data Architecture?</summary><br><b>

An answer from [talend.com](https://www.talend.com/resources/what-is-data-architecture):

"Data architecture is the process of standardizing how organizations collect, store, transform, distribute, and use data. The goal is to deliver relevant data to people who need it, when they need it, and help them make sense of it."
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>Explain the different formats of data</summary><br><b>

* Structured - data that has defined format and length (e.g. numbers, words)
* Semi-structured - Doesn't conform to a specific format but is self-describing (e.g. XML, SWIFT)
* Unstructured - does not follow a specific format (e.g. images, test messages)

## Packer

<details>
<summary>What is Packer? What is it used for?</summary><br><b>

In general, Packer automates machine images creation.
It allows you to focus on configuration prior to deployment while making the images. This allows you start the instances much faster in most cases.
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>Packer follows a "configuration->deployment" model or "deployment->configuration"?</summary><br><b>

A configuration->deployment which has some advantages like:

1. Deployment Speed - you configure once prior to deployment instead of configuring every time you deploy. This allows you to start instances/services much quicker.
2. More immutable infrastructure - with configuration->deployment it's not likely to have very different deployments since most of the configuration is done prior to the deployment. Issues like dependencies errors are handled/discovered prior to deployment in this model.
</b></details>

## Release

<details>
<summary>Explain Semantic Versioning</summary><br><b>

[This](https://semver.org/) page explains it perfectly:

```
Given a version number MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH, increment the:

MAJOR version when you make incompatible API changes
MINOR version when you add functionality in a backwards compatible manner
PATCH version when you make backwards compatible bug fixes
Additional labels for pre-release and build metadata are available as extensions to the MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH format.
```
